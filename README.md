# Overview of the Repo!

I code here my basic wild ideas such as using different losses with different models and also implement vanilla models from scratch. I use online resources to implement the Graphs of Loss over epochs and accuracy over epochs, so they are susceptible to errors.
Hope this repo helps y'all!!
